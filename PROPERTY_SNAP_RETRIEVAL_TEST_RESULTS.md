### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Database Queries Tested
```sql
-- Report retrieval by user ID
SELECT * FROM "PropertyReport" WHERE "userId" = ? ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

-- Pagination
SELECT * FROM "PropertyReport" WHERE "userId" = ? ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 3 OFFSET 0;

-- Filtering by public status
SELECT * FROM "PropertyReport" WHERE "userId" = ? AND "isPublic" = true;

-- Report by share token
SELECT * FROM "PropertyReport" WHERE "shareToken" = ?;

-- Report with user relations
SELECT * FROM "PropertyReport" p JOIN "User" u ON p."userId" = u."id" WHERE p."userId" = ?;

-- Location filtering
SELECT * FROM "PropertyReport" WHERE "userId" = ? AND "locationLat" BETWEEN ? AND ?;

-- Report counting
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "PropertyReport" WHERE "userId" = ?;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "PropertyReport" WHERE "userId" = ? AND "isPublic" = true;
```

#### API Response Samples
```json
// User Reports API Response
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}

// Share Report API Response
{
  "error": "Report not found"
}

// Delete Report API Response
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```
